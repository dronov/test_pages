#What is Hackathon?

A hackathon is a gathering where programmers collaboratively code in an extreme manner over a short period of time. Hackathons are at least a few days - or over a weekend - and generally no longer than a week. While working on a particular project, the idea is for each developer to be have the ability and freedom to work on whatever he/she wants.

A hackathon is also known as a hackfest or hack day.
